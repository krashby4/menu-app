# The Menu App - a rather simple way to organize your meals

The goal was to create a simple weekly menu app where users can add recipes and have a easy way to view the ingredients needed and details on how to prepare the recipes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What the app can do:

- You can add meals to certain days of the week by clicking the drop-down menus
- You can use the dynamic new recipe modal to store recipe information

## Unfinished/missing features of the app:
- Added meals do not have a link which would take the user to a site detailing how to prepare the meal
- There's no database or server on which to save new recipes. The most the modal does is log the data to the console.
- One cannot save the menu for future reference
- Other recipe information, such as ingredients needed, are not shown in the app
